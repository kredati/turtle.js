A few notes:
*   Consider interpretation: the Java 3D turtle graphics package has a TurtleCommand class--construct commands (for example, using the draw() loop) rather than delivering commands directly.
*   This lets you implement repeat() differently, and introduces interesting possibilities for undo().
